<h2>What Is USPS Certified Mail?</h2>
<p>USPS Certified Mail provides proof that you mailed a letter and proof of delivery (or attempted delivery). The sender receives a mailing receipt, and the delivery is recorded by USPS. It is commonly used for legal notices, demand letters, lease terminations, IRS correspondence, and other important documents where proof of mailing is required.</p>
<p>With an optional Electronic Return Receipt, you also receive confirmation of who signed for the letter and when it was delivered.</p>
