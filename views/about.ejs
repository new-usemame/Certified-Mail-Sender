<h2>About Certified Mail Sender</h2>
<p class="subtitle">Making USPS Certified Mail accessible from anywhere.</p>

<p>Certified Mail Sender exists because sending a certified letter should not require a trip to the post office. Whether you are mailing a legal notice, a demand letter, or IRS correspondence, our service handles the entire process online &mdash; from printing to certified postage to delivery through USPS.</p>

<hr>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>You fill out a simple form on our website with the sender and recipient addresses, then type your letter or upload a PDF. After a secure payment through Stripe, we print your letter, prepare the envelope, apply USPS Certified Mail postage, and drop it in the mail. You receive a tracking number by email so you can follow your letter every step of the way.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Secure and Trusted</h2>
<p>We take security and trust seriously:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>USPS Certified Mail</strong> &mdash; Your letter is sent through the official USPS Certified Mail service with a tracking number and proof of mailing.</li>
  <li><strong>Stripe payments</strong> &mdash; All payments are processed by Stripe, a PCI-compliant payment processor. We never see or store your credit card information.</li>
  <li><strong>Your data</strong> &mdash; We store only the information needed to process and track your order. We do not sell or share your personal information.</li>
</ul>
