<h2>About Certified Mail Sender</h2>
<p class="subtitle">Official USPS Certified Mail service, accessible from anywhere.</p>

<p>Certified Mail Sender exists because sending a certified letter should not require a trip to the post office. Whether you are mailing a legal notice, a demand letter, or IRS correspondence, our service handles the entire process online &mdash; from printing to certified postage to delivery through the United States Postal Service.</p>

<hr>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>You fill out a simple form on our website with the sender and recipient addresses, then type your letter or upload a PDF. After a secure, encrypted payment through Stripe, we print your letter, prepare the envelope, apply official USPS Certified Mail postage, and drop it in the mail. You receive a tracking number by email so you can follow your letter every step of the way on USPS.com.</p>
